### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luc. I work for Mott MacDonald in the Project Finance teams, and wear a digital delivery network leader hat. 

I got back into coding in .. early 90s, testing BASIC on the Apple ][ my father used to write his thesis. Since, I've tested a few languages, broken a few things but hopefully built more.

Python is now my tool of choice, happily been using it for 
- Ad-hoc support tools
- Being on hackathons podiums (no gold medal so far!)
- developping web-apps on heroku and azure
- play with GIS frameworks and try and automate things where possible
- explore open data
- supporting colleagues as need be

From a personal point of view, I'm into
- open source, especially hardware, been dabbling cofounder of the echOpen association in 2014, but also promoting the use of open-source ultrasound hardware to give affordable, accessible tools to students and researchers
- retroengineering
- understanding how stuff work
- learning - big fan of MOOCs too =)
